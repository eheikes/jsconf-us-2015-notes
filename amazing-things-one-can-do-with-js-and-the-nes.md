# "Amazing Things One Can Do With JS and the NES" by [Michael Matuzak](https://twitter.com/mmatuzak)

This talk basically went through the speaker's process of creating 8-bit music on the NES, with sound demos thoughout.

([code repo](https://github.com/emkay/nesly-sound))

* Goal: make it easy to write music for NES
* Project parts:
  * ASM sound engine
  * JS API
* NES has 2 square wave channels, a triangle wave, and a "noise".
* NES is monophonic, so we have to use arpeggios to mimic chords.
* Future
  * NES assembler in JS
  * web UI tools
